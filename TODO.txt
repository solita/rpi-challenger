OK - new terminology: participant, tournament, round, strike, challenge, question-answer
OK - show a log of failed challenges
	OK - save in domain model
	OK - layout
	OK - give unique ID for participants
	OK - use the ID in showing that participant's details
OK - load challenges from a directory
	OK - find out how to do it - eval or something?
	OK - reload before polling
- fix: doesn't reload changes to a challenge file (e.g. challenge function added), only loads new files
- trim reponses from participants to ignore trailing newlines
- handle failures form poller
	- fix: polling crashes if malformed URL, or if service respondes with garbage
- poll servers automatically, many times per second, infinite loop
	- one poller thread per server
- calculate the score automatically, in 1 minute ticks
	- start a timer
	- reload challenges in the beginning of a round
- make parsing easier; separate operator and operands by newline?
- better score calculation rules
	- take challenge points into consideration
	- use the points of the highest hit below the lowest miss
- show score accumulation history
	- save score for each tick as [timestamp score]
	- calculate total score from the history
	- print the history as text
	- visualize the history as graph (find a JS graph library)
- better graphics
